- plot.py is the main program. Contains two functions: 
	-) plot_xy(filename, headernames) and 
	-) plot_errorbar(filename, headernames).

plot_xy creates 2D plot 
plot_errorbar creates 2D plot with error bars. There are two possible outcomes in this function (see comments on plot.py)

- tableau_data_colors.py just contains different color palettes
